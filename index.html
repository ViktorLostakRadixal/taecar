                <h2>TAECAR: A Vision for Conceptual Art</h2>
                <p>Welcome to TAECAR (Transcendence Archive | European Conceptual Art Repository), a unique archive and dynamic platform dedicated to contemporary European conceptual art.</p>
                <p>At a time when artworks increasingly materialize in intangible forms – from performances and digital records to complex contractual relationships – TAECAR introduces a new model for their preservation, research, and accessibility. Our mission is not only to meticulously archive and manage these often-fleeting works but also to actively support their critical reflection, presentation, <em>and accessibility to a wide range of interested parties, emphasizing the support of diverse perspectives and inclusive dialogue.</em></p>
                <h3>Stability and Independent Vision</h3>
                <p>The TAECAR project was initiated and is produced under the auspices of <strong>A VIRTU</strong>, which provides a stable operational and technological background. However, a key element of our identity is the <strong>guarantee of complete artistic and curatorial independence</strong>. The strategic direction of the collection, acquisition policy, and professional quality are guaranteed by the renowned art historian and curator <strong>Mgr. Jana Písaříková, Ph.D.</strong>, acting as TAECAR's Art Director. This combination ensures both long-term sustainability and an uncompromising level of expertise and relevance in our activities.</p>
                <h3>What We Do</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>We build and manage a specialized collection of European conceptual art with a focus on performance art.</li>
                    <li>We offer unique collection resources for research purposes to institutions and individuals.</li>
                    <li>We provide comprehensive services, including the preparation of turnkey exhibitions and expert consultations.</li>
                    <li>We actively map the scene and connect actors in the field of contemporary art.</li>
                    <li>We strive to strengthen the role of conceptual art in public discourse.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>TAECAR aims to be not just an archive, but a living center of knowledge, dialogue, and collaboration at the European level. We are a bridge between the past, present, and future of conceptual art.</p>

                <h2>Context: The Challenge & Opportunity</h2>
                <h3>The Challenge: Fluid Art in Rigid Structures</h3>
                <p>Contemporary art, especially conceptual art, constantly confronts us with questions about the nature of the artwork itself. Traditional archiving and collection-building methods often reach their limits when faced with art that is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ephemeral and Intangible:</strong> Performances, events, digital works, or social interventions leave traces that require specific methods of documentation and preservation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hybrid and Complex:</strong> Works often combine physical objects, texts, sound, video, software, and legal documents. Their management requires an interdisciplinary approach.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legally Intertwined:</strong> Copyrights, license agreements, and terms of use are often not just administrative burdens but integral parts of the artwork and its concept.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fragmented:</strong> Resources and documentation on significant works and artists are often scattered among various institutions, private archives, or digital platforms, hindering comprehensive research. Furthermore, in the Czech and Central European context, there is a noticeable lack of systematic acquisition and archiving of, for example, performance art.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>The Opportunity: TAECAR as a Node in the Network</h3>
                <p>It is precisely in these challenges that we see a unique opportunity. <strong>TAECAR</strong> emerges as a response to the need for a specialized center that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Systematically builds and manages a comprehensive collection focused on European conceptual art, emphasizing previously neglected areas like performance art.</li>
                    <li>Develops and applies expert know-how in archiving hybrid works, managing digital data (including our 5TB+ holdings), and navigating the legal aspects of art.</li>
                    <li>Creates a centralized resource for researchers, curators, students, and institutions, facilitating access to materials and supporting a deeper understanding of contemporary art.</li>
                    <li>Actively connects the scene – mapping existing resources, initiating collaboration between institutions and private entities, and offering a platform for knowledge sharing.</li>
                    <li>Enables new forms of presentation and research through turnkey exhibitions, research support, expert consultations, and a planned digital platform.</li>
                    <li>Supports artists by not only preserving their works but also contextualizing them and making them accessible for future generations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>TAECAR does not want to be just a passive archive. We aim to be an active node in the contemporary art network – a place where knowledge is concentrated, shared, and further developed.</p>

                    <li><strong>Processual and Documentary Nature:</strong> Focusing on art where the process of creation, documentation, and contextual information form an integral part of the work.</li>
                </ul>
