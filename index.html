                <h2>TAECAR: A Vision for Conceptual Art</h2>
                <p>Welcome to <strong>TAECAR</strong> (Transcendence Archive | European Conceptual Art Repository), a unique archive and dynamic platform dedicated to contemporary European conceptual art.</p>
                <p>At a time when artworks increasingly materialize in intangible forms – from performances and digital records to complex contractual relationships – TAECAR introduces a new model for their preservation, research, and accessibility. Our mission is not only to meticulously archive and manage these often-fleeting works but also to actively support their critical reflection, presentation, <em>and accessibility to a wide range of interested parties, emphasizing the support of diverse perspectives and inclusive dialogue.</em></p>
                <h3>Stability and Independent Vision</h3>
                <p>The TAECAR project was initiated and is produced under the auspices of <strong>A VIRTÙ RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGIES s.r.o.</strong>, which provides a stable operational and technological background. However, a key element of our identity is the <strong>guarantee of complete artistic and curatorial independence</strong>. The strategic direction of the collection, acquisition policy, and professional quality are guaranteed by the renowned art historian and curator <strong>Mgr. Jana Písaříková, Ph.D.</strong>, acting as TAECAR's Art Director. This combination ensures both long-term sustainability and an uncompromising level of expertise and relevance in our activities.</p>
                <h3>What We Do</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>We build and manage a specialized collection of European conceptual art with a focus on performance art.</li>
                    <li>We offer unique collection resources for research purposes to institutions and individuals.</li>
                    <li>We provide comprehensive services, including the preparation of turnkey exhibitions and expert consultations.</li>
                    <li>We actively map the scene and connect actors in the field of contemporary art.</li>
                    <li>We strive to strengthen the role of conceptual art in public discourse.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>TAECAR aims to be not just an archive, but a living center of knowledge, dialogue, and collaboration at the European level. We are a bridge between the past, present, and future of conceptual art.</p>

                <h2>Context: The Challenge & Opportunity</h2>
                <h3>The Challenge: Fluid Art in Rigid Structures</h3>
                <p>Contemporary art, especially conceptual art, constantly confronts us with questions about the nature of the artwork itself. Traditional archiving and collection-building methods often reach their limits when faced with art that is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ephemeral and Intangible:</strong> Performances, events, digital works, or social interventions leave traces that require specific methods of documentation and preservation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hybrid and Complex:</strong> Works often combine physical objects, texts, sound, video, software, and legal documents. Their management requires an interdisciplinary approach.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legally Intertwined:</strong> Copyrights, license agreements, and terms of use are often not just administrative burdens but integral parts of the artwork and its concept.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fragmented:</strong> Resources and documentation on significant works and artists are often scattered among various institutions, private archives, or digital platforms, hindering comprehensive research. Furthermore, in the Czech and Central European context, there is a noticeable lack of systematic acquisition and archiving of, for example, performance art.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>The Opportunity: TAECAR as a Node in the Network</h3>
                <p>It is precisely in these challenges that we see a unique opportunity. <strong>TAECAR</strong> emerges as a response to the need for a specialized center that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Systematically builds and manages a comprehensive collection focused on European conceptual art, emphasizing previously neglected areas like performance art.</li>
                    <li>Develops and applies expert know-how in archiving hybrid works, managing digital data (including our 5TB+ holdings), and navigating the legal aspects of art.</li>
                    <li>Creates a centralized resource for researchers, curators, students, and institutions, facilitating access to materials and supporting a deeper understanding of contemporary art.</li>
                    <li>Actively connects the scene – mapping existing resources, initiating collaboration between institutions and private entities, and offering a platform for knowledge sharing.</li>
                    <li>Enables new forms of presentation and research through turnkey exhibitions, research support, expert consultations, and a planned digital platform.</li>
                    <li>Supports artists by not only preserving their works but also contextualizing them and making them accessible for future generations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>TAECAR does not want to be just a passive archive. We aim to be an active node in the contemporary art network – a place where knowledge is concentrated, shared, and further developed.</p>

                <h2>TAECAR: Concept and Vision</h2>
                <h3>What Does TAECAR Mean?</h3>
                <p><strong>Transcendence:</strong> Refers to our effort to cross boundaries – between physical and digital, local and global, artistic creation and its legal framework. Symbolizes the ability of conceptual art to overcome traditional categories and our commitment to finding innovative ways for its preservation and interpretation.</p>
                <p><strong>Archive:</strong> Represents a systematic approach, long-term perspective, and commitment to preserving cultural heritage. It underscores our role as a reliable resource for researchers and institutions, based on professional standards and meticulous documentation.</p>
                <p><strong>European:</strong> Defines our primary geographical context and ambition to connect local scenes in a broader European dialogue. It reflects our effort towards international networking and collaboration.</p>
                <p><strong>Conceptual Art:</strong> Clearly defines our focus on the art movement where the idea, process, documentation, and context play a key role, often more important than the physical object itself. It encompasses a wide range of expressions, including performance art, to which we pay special attention.</p>
                <p><strong>Repository:</strong> Emphasizes our function as a secure storage and center for active management of diverse materials – from physical artifacts and extensive digital files to complex legal documentation. It is a place where value is deposited but also made accessible in a controlled manner.</p>
                <h3>Our Vision</h3>
                <p>We aim to become the <strong>leading European center</strong> for the research, preservation, and mediation of contemporary conceptual art. TAECAR's vision is to be a dynamic, <em>open, and inclusive</em> hub in the international network, one that not only protects heritage but also actively stimulates new research, supports artists and curators <em>from diverse backgrounds</em>, and contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex forms of contemporary art <strong>in all its diversity</strong>.</p>
                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>To build and manage a specialized, independently curated collection of European conceptual art with an emphasis on performance art and other challenging forms.</li>
                    <li>To develop and apply cutting-edge methods for archiving, digitization, description (according to standards like Dublin Core, PREMIS), and long-term preservation of hybrid materials and digital data.</li>
                    <li>To provide maximum support to researchers – making our holdings accessible (based on registration), offering professional assistance, and actively approaching universities to utilize the collection for qualification theses.</li>
                    <li>To offer professional services, including the preparation of turnkey exhibitions and expert consultations in the fields of conceptual art, its archiving, and management.</li>
                    <li>To systematically map the contemporary conceptual art scene and connect its actors, potentially mediating access to works outside our direct administration.</li>
                    <li>To actively contribute to the public discourse on contemporary art through publishing activities, educational programs, and organizing expert events.</li>
                    <li><em>To actively promote diversity and inclusion</em> both within our acquisition strategy (seeking works from artists of diverse identities, origins, and perspectives) and through our programs and partnerships.</li>
                    <li><em>To adhere to ethical principles and shared values</em> in our activities, including transparency (within the limits set by copyright and data protection) and equal access to our resources.</li>
                    <li>To proactively establish collaborations with a wide range of partners from the public and private sectors across Europe.</li>
                    <li>To cultivate a network of contacts and partnerships within the European context.</li>

                <h2>The TAECAR Collection</h2>
                <h3>Collection Profile</h3>
                <p>Our collection-building activity, guided by the independent vision of Art Director Jana Písaříková, focuses on <strong>European conceptual art, primarily from the 1990s to the present.</strong> We place particular emphasis on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Performance Art:</strong> Systematically seeking and acquiring documentation and relics of performance art, an area often overlooked by traditional collection-building institutions, especially in the (Central) European context.</li>
                    <li><strong>Boundary-Pushing Art:</strong> We are interested in works that challenge established categories, work with new media, critically reflect social or political issues, <em>or open spaces for dialogue about identity, diversity, and social change.</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Processual and Documentary Nature:</strong> Focusing on art where the process of creation, documentation, and contextual information form an integral part of the work.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Geographically, we monitor the pan-European scene with a natural emphasis on the Central European region, which is home to many inspiring but hitherto insufficiently mapped artistic expressions.</p>
                <h3>Nature of Holdings</h3>
                <p>The TAECAR collection is intentionally <strong>hybrid</strong> and reflects the nature of conceptual art itself. Our holdings include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Physical Objects:</strong> Installation components, performance props, photographic prints, artist books, drawings, objects, ephemeral materials, and other artifacts bearing traces of the artistic process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Digital Data:</strong> An extensive and constantly growing archive (currently over 5 TB) containing video and audio documentation of performances and events, digital photographs, software-based art, project documentation, databases, and other formats of digital art and its records.</li>
                    <li><strong>Textual and Legal Documents:</strong> Certificates of authenticity, license agreements, project descriptions, scripts, artist correspondence, critical texts, and other documents that are often crucial for understanding and interpreting the work and its legal status.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We manage these diverse materials not in isolation, but as an interconnected whole that together forms a comprehensive picture of the given artwork or project.</p>
                <h3>Significance of the Collection</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Uniqueness of Focus:</strong> The targeted specialization in conceptual and performance art fills a gap in existing collection holdings and creates a unique resource for studying these areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rich Research Potential:</strong> The hybrid nature of the materials, including hard-to-access legal and process documents, offers extraordinary opportunities for new perspectives and interpretations in art history, curatorial practice, media theory, or legal theory.</li>
                    <li><strong>Preservation of Cultural Heritage:</strong> We actively preserve and protect significant, yet often ephemeral, works of contemporary European art, ensuring their accessibility for future generations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Contextualization and Interpretation:</strong> TAECAR is not just a depository. Through the expert work of the Art Director, research support, and planned outputs, we actively strive to place works in a broader context and support their critical reflection.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The TAECAR collection is an investment in a deeper understanding of contemporary art and its complex manifestations.</p>

                <h2>TAECAR Principles and Values</h2>
                <p>We are convinced that the foundation of any meaningful project lies in firmly established values and clearly formulated principles. At TAECAR, they form the backbone of all activities and are reflected in every decision. Below, we offer a detailed insight into what defines TAECAR and where it is heading.</p>

                        <p><strong>Preamble: What TAECAR is About and Why We Do It</strong></p>
                        <p>Welcome to the world of TAECAR (Transcendence Archive | European Conceptual Art Repository).</p>
                        <p>TAECAR is a process, a living laboratory, a dynamic platform, and a philosophical commitment. The mission, pursued with full dedication and passion, is to systematically discover paths to European conceptual art in its broadest <strong>global context</strong>. It is critically viewed, preserved with loving care, and – no less importantly – innovatively mediated. The focus is primarily on its forms that are as fleeting as a thought, as procedural as life itself, and as provocative as a well-posed question; on art that often exhibits <strong>polycrystalline subversiveness</strong> towards established norms.</p>
                        <p>TAECAR is a community that deeply believes in the transformative power of art. There is a conviction here that it is necessary not only to preserve its traces for those who come after us but also to constantly seek new ways to understand it and to conduct an open and <strong>inclusive</strong> dialogue about it, respecting a <strong>diversity</strong> of views and transcending cultural or ideological boundaries. The present document reveals the fundamental values and principles that serve as a compass for daily activities, shape the culture, and guide decision-making within TAECAR. It is a promise of openness and, at the same time, an invitation to collaboration and sharing.</p>

                        <h2>Article I: Independence, Courage, and Artistic Excellence</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li><h3>Curatorial Freedom and Integrity</h3><p>The artistic direction of TAECAR, especially its acquisition policy, project selection, and overall content vision for the collection, is guided exclusively by the highest professional and artistic criteria, guaranteed by the Art Director of TAECAR. Independence from external political, ideological, or commercial pressures forms the basis of TAECAR's artistic integrity. The vision is led by art, not compromise – this is a firm conviction.</p></li>
                            <li><h3>Critical Expertise and Intellectual Depth</h3><p>All TAECAR activities stand on the solid foundations of thorough research, continuous critical reflection, and a sincere effort for maximum relevance in the context of contemporary art, its history, and theory. The art world is constantly evolving, and TAECAR with it. Active participation in professional discourse and support for the creation of new knowledge are a matter of course, as there is a conviction that meaning lies precisely in the search for a_substance.</p></li>
                            <li><h3>Courage for Non-Conformity and Support for Visionaries</h3><p>TAECAR values and actively seeks out art and artists who push boundaries, question established norms, experiment with form and content, and open new perspectives. Non-conformity is supported, that <strong>polycrystalline subversiveness</strong> which is the essence of conceptual art, and an open mind is applied to artistically significant themes that provoke deep thought and reflect the complexity of the world.</p></li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2>Article II: Innovation and Advanced Technologies</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li><h3>Pioneering in Methods and Thinking</h3><p>TAECAR is a laboratory for new approaches. Innovative methods for archiving, managing, analyzing, and mediating art are actively developed, tested, and applied. The potential of <strong>state-of-the-art digital tools</strong> and other cutting-edge technologies is utilized strategically and always with ethical reflection. TAECAR is open to experimentation and actively seeks new paths.</p></li>
                            <li><h3>Adaptability and Strategic Flexibility</h3><p>The art world is vibrant, technology is advancing rapidly, and the social context is changing faster than spring weather. This reality is fully reflected. Structures, processes, and above all, the thinking within TAECAR are therefore designed to allow for rapid and effective adaptation to new challenges and opportunities, without losing sight of long-term goals.</p></li>
                            <li><h3>Advanced Tools as Support and Protection</h3><p>Advanced technological tools are effective partners for TAECAR, expanding cognitive and operational capabilities, helping to streamline processes, uncover new connections, and ensure a high level of security and control over data. Key strategic decisions, ethical oversight, and final curatorial responsibility, however, always remain firmly in human hands. Technology expands possibilities, while the human spirit and ethics determine the direction.</p></li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2>Article III: Ethics, Integrity, and Responsibility</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li><h3>Transparency with Reason, Confidentiality as a Commitment</h3><p>TAECAR openly communicates its goals, general methods, and – to a relevant and safe extent – the results of its work. It is a self-evident duty to protect sensitive information, copyrights, and the privacy of collaborating individuals and artists. Trust is built on openness and, at the same time, on the responsible handling of information.</p></li>
                            <li><h3>The Highest Ethical Standards as a Foundation</h3><p>All TAECAR conduct, both internal and external, is governed by uncompromising ethical standards. Corruption, conflicts of interest, discrimination, abuse of position, or any other unethical or illegal practices are not tolerated and are actively opposed. The TAECAR Ethics Hotline is one of the tools for maintaining and protecting these standards.</p></li>
                            <li><h3>Responsibility Towards Artists, Works, and Resources</h3><p>Artworks, their creators, and provided resources (financial and informational) are treated with the utmost respect, care, and responsibility. Attention is paid to correct copyright management, dignified and safe handling of artifacts and data, and the effective and transparent use of entrusted funds. Data, artists, and TAECAR's vision are protected – this is the foundation of the work.</p></li>
                            <li><h3>Security as a Priority</h3><p>Multi-level security measures are implemented and continuously improved to protect all collected data, physical assets, and TAECAR's intellectual property. The commitment is to information protection and risk minimization; the best available practices are used for this, including the <strong>use of advanced systems for managing and protecting primary data</strong>.</p></li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2>Article IV: Openness, Strength of a Connected Network, Respect for Diversity, and Joint Growth</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li><h3>Principle of Openness and Institutional Cooperation</h3><p>TAECAR is fundamentally an <strong>open</strong> platform. It actively seeks and develops cooperation with all relevant entities – museums, galleries, universities, research institutions, private collectors, foundations, and individual artists and researchers. TAECAR does not confine itself to any limited time-space nor does it succumb to cultural, ideological, or other artificial boundaries.</p></li>
                            <li><h3>Strategic Network Building as a Global Ecosystem</h3><p>At TAECAR, there is a belief in the exponential power of intelligent and targeted collaboration. An international network of key collaborators, partners, institutions, and supporters who share TAECAR's values and vision is actively built and cultivated. The network is based on mutual respect, trust, the sharing of unique knowledge, and a common interest in the future of conceptual art. There is a conviction that cooperation without borders and equal access are the way forward.</p></li>
                            <li><h3>Flat, Agile Structure</h3><p>TAECAR's internal and external network structures are intentionally designed to be flat, decentralized, and highly agile. This arrangement allows for direct and effective communication and flexible engagement of individual nodes.</p></li>
                            <li><h3>Inclusivity and Diversity as a Source of Strength and a Fundamental Principle</h3><p>Active efforts are made to create a truly <strong>inclusive</strong> environment and to support <strong>diversity</strong> in all its forms – not just as a declaration, but as a fundamental principle of TAECAR's activities. This approach is reflected in the team, the network of collaborators, the acquisition strategy, and the programmatic focus. Different perspectives, experiences, identities, and cultural backgrounds are welcomed, sought after, and valued, because there is a deep conviction that it is precisely in their creative connection and mutual respect that the source of TAECAR's creativity, relevance, innovativeness, and strength lies. Every voice and perspective holds indispensable value and contributes to the richness of the whole.</p></li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2>Article V: Enduring Vision, Sustainable Future, and Legacy for Generations</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li><h3>Building an Institution with a Lasting Impact</h3><p>TAECAR's highest goal is to build an institution of lasting value and international significance. The intention is for TAECAR to outlive short-term trends and become a key reference point, a source of knowledge and inspiration for the study and understanding of European conceptual art in its broadest <strong>global context</strong> for future generations. Simply put, values are being built that will endure.</p></li>
                            <li><h3>Strategic Sustainability and Growth</h3><p>Innovative and diversified models of operation and financing are proactively sought, developed, and implemented. This includes strategic foundation activities focused on building the collection and exclusive partnerships. The aim is to ensure the long-term financial, technological, and operational stability and growth of TAECAR, without in any way compromising the project's independence, ethical principles, and core values. Stability is, after all, the foundation for the vision.</p></li>
                            <li><h3>Legacy of Knowledge and Cultivation of Critical Thinking</h3><p>TAECAR's role is understood not only as that of archivists and administrators but also as active co-creators of a cultural and intellectual legacy. Excellent research is supported, knowledge is shared, critical thinking is stimulated, and there is an effort to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex and often provocative forms of contemporary art and their relevance to today's ever-changing world.</p></li>
                        </ol>
