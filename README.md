# TAECAR Website

## Description

This repository contains the source code for the official website of **TAECAR (Transcendence Archive | European Conceptual Art Repository)**, located at [www.taecar.art](https://www.taecar.art). TAECAR is a specialized archive and dynamic platform dedicated to contemporary European conceptual art, with a special focus on performance art and hybrid media.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this website is to:
* Present the concept, vision, mission, and collection of TAECAR to potential partners, stakeholders, researchers, artists, and the public.
* Outline the services offered by TAECAR (e.g., exhibitions on demand, research support, expert consultations).
* Serve as the main online presence and point of contact for the archive.
* (Future) Potentially integrate access to the archive's digital database or online portal.

## Key Features (Current Implementation)

* **Single-page presentation format:** Uses full-page scrolling effect (via Scrollify.js) for a guided user experience.
* **Responsive Design:** Basic responsiveness for viewing on different screen sizes (further refinement needed).
* **Content-focused:** Presents the core information about TAECAR developed through initial planning stages.

## Tech Stack

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (ES6+)
* jQuery (dependency for Scrollify.js)
* Scrollify.js (for full-page scrolling effect)

## Status

* **Under Development:** Initial structure, content, basic styling, and scrolling functionality implemented. Requires further refinement of content layout (especially for long sections), visual design, and responsiveness.
